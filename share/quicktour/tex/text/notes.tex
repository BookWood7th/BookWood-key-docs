\section{Notes}

The \kt\ is continually developed, meaning that parts of this
tutorial may be outdated when you read it. Moreover, the JML semantics
are subject to discussion, and there is no formal semantics
specification for JML. Differences between the JML semantics of other
tools and the (implicitly given) semantics in \KeY\ are therefore
possible. The JML dialect of \KeY\ even extends JML in some points (as
we have seen above for \textit{assignable} clauses in
\textit{loop\_invariants}).

\KeY\ 2.10 has been tested on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.
